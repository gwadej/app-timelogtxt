=head1 NAME

App::TimelogTxt::Day - Class representing a day as a set of times, tasks, and
durations.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes App::TimelogTxt::Day version 0.03_3

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use App::TimelogTxt::Day;

    my $day = App::TimelogTxt::Day->new( '2013-07-02' );
    my $last;
    while( my $event = get_new_event() )
    {
        $day->update_dur( \%last, $event->epoch );
        $day->start_task( $event );
        $last = $event;
    }
    $day->print_day_detail( \*STDOUT );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Objects of this class represent the events of a particular day. The object
tracks projects and combines time spent on the same task from multiple points
in the day.

The class also provides the ability to print various reports on the day's
activities.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 new( $stamp )

Creates a Day object that collects the events for the date specified by
the C<$stamp>. This C<$stamp> must be in the standard format YYYY-MM-DD

=head2 $d->is_empty()

Returns C<true> only if no events have been added to the day.

=head2 $d->update_dur( $last, $epoch )

Update the duration of the most recent task, using the C<$last> variable
which contains the information from the last event and the C<$epoch> time
from the new event.

=head2 $d->start_task( $event )

Initialize a new task item in the day based on the L<App::TimelogTxt::Event>
object supplied in C<$event>. This method only starts a task if no previous
matching task exists in the day.

=head2 $d->print_day_detail( $fh )

Print formatted day information to the supplied filehandle C<$fh>. If no
filehandle is supplied, print to C<STDOUT>.

The output starts with the current datestamp and duration for the day. Indented
under that are individual projects. Individual tasks are indented under the
projects.

This is the most detailed report.

=head2 $d->print_day_summary( $fh )

Print formatted day information to the supplied filehandle C<$fh>. If no
filehandle is supplied, print to C<STDOUT>.

The output starts with the current datestamp and duration for the day. Indented
under that are individual projects.

=head2 $d->print_hours( $fh )

Print formatted day information to the supplied filehandle C<$fh>. If no
filehandle is supplied, print to C<STDOUT>.

The output only displays the current datestamp and duration for the day.

This is the least detailed report.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

App::TimelogTxt::Day requires no configuration files or environment variables.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

None.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No bugs have been reported.
